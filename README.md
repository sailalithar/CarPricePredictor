# CarPricePredictor
This project can be used to predict used car prices based on their characteristics

# The problem

Used cars price need to be evaluated both by sellers and consumers to allot correct amount before any deal. It should be beneficial for both parties depending on the car characteristics. Different models will be used to predict the actual market value of a used car. Their output will be compared and the model with best outcome is used for predictions. 

# The customer

Used car dealers, Individuals are the target customers for this project. This predictor can help them offer competitive prices and make informed decisions either while buying used car or selling a car.

# The Dataset

It is a supervised learning problem and data is imported from kaggle. The used cars dataset is uploaded by Austin Reese and it contains all vehicle listings from Craigslist. It contains all relevant information that Craigslist provides on car sales including columns like price, condition, manufacturer, latitude/longitude, and 18 other categories

Below are the 4 steps to extract useful information from data and develop different models. 
1. Data Wrangling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Development
4. Model Evaluation
